On board was Jacob Sammet and his family.&amp;nbsp; Many of us who research the Summit(t) tree think that he may have been the father of both Christian Sammet of Indiana and of Johan Franz Sammet of North Carolina.&amp;nbsp; I have managed to get copies of the documentation of that arrival and have placed them in the SummittFamilyOnline.com database for members of that site to be able to use in their research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm going to be bringing back the Summitt Family Quarterly starting with the April issue.&amp;nbsp;

A new discussion area for Summitt descendants has been created on FaceBook.&amp;nbsp; It was created by two daughters of William Ira Summitt of Kentucky.&amp;nbsp; I'm currently using information they have provided to seek documentation tying William Ira Summitt and his line into the Johann Franz Sammet or Christian Sammet line as are most Summit's and Summitt's we've found in the past.&amp;nbsp; I've posted some of these documents to the SummittFamilyOnline.com database.&amp;nbsp; Feel free to sign up for an account at the site or, if you are having problems signing up, send me an email and I'll create you an account.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Another member on the FaceBook Summitt Research site, April Summitt, is also descended from Johan Franz Sammet and I plan on posting that lineage soon there. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Most of the Summit(t)s found so far in Kentucky are traceable back to either Christian Sammet (who we think was Johan Franz' brother and son of Jacob Sammet) or to Christian Summit (Johan Franz' son), both of Indiana.&amp;nbsp; Another current research and writing project of mine deals with the daughter of George Summit of Kentucky, Cynthia Ann Summit, who shows up married to James Hook here in Columbia, Missouri in 1828.&amp;nbsp; I hope to finish it up soon and post it here to the SummittFamilyQuarterly.org site.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Please feel free to contact me if you would like me to help you with your family research.&amp;nbsp;

Aytch" by Sam R. Watkins</title><content type='html'>Finished reading this the second time just a while back.  If you aren't aware of what this is about, you should be.  Sam R. Watkins was from Columbia, Tennessee and he fought as a proud member of the First Tennessee Regiment.  He fought at all of the First Tennessee's major engagements from Shiloh to Nashville. While I found no mention of any Summit(t) in the book, I do know that many Summit(t)s from Tennessee fought for the South and while James Lee Summitt (5th Tennessee USA) fought against the First Tennessee CSA at Franklin and Nashville and James Lee's father-in-law died at Franklin fighting for the South.  Joseph and Daniel Summit, uncles of James Lee, were captured at Vicksburg as was another of James Lee's in-laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is, if you want to know how many of the Summit(t) men from Tennessee lived their lives during the Civil War and in some cases died, you have to read this book.  I understand Watkin's granddaughter has just published a new version of the book with new material that was added after the original was first published in serial format in the local Columbia, Tennessee newspaper during 1881-1882.  Two thousand copies of the report were published later with two small reprints.  The 1962 edition was the first major mass market printing of this memoir.  I recommend any historian of the civil war period and any Summit(t) Family Historian needs to read this.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20159960-4070957435867194637?l=www.summittfamilyquarterly.org%2Fblog%2Fblog.htm' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/4070957435867194637/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20159960&amp;postID=4070957435867194637' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/4070957435867194637'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/4070957435867194637'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.summittfamilyquarterly.org/blog/2009/10/co-aytch-by-sam-r-watkins.html' title='&quot;Co.

For someone with little experience with the Web and just as little experience doing genealogy online this book is fantastic.  It is for beginners so if you have some experience you'll be bored reading most of this book but that's OK.  I was happy to see that she told readers NOT to put music on their sites.  That is one way not to get me NOT to visit the site again.   Beginners, buy this book and take head of its recommendations and you won't come across as a beginner.  If you are an old hand, buy it and check your site against the recommendations.

Schweitzer, PhD, ScD</title><content type='html'>I think &lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;I've said this before but I started researching my family history sometime around forty years ago now.  One of the first stories about my family I learned was my great-grandfather going north from his Tennessee home and fighting for the Union.  Over the years I've learned some of the stories about him were just that, stories.  But I've also learned how he was charged with desertion because he when home for Christmas and how his father, my great-great-grandfather, was jailed for aiding the enemy by the confederate authorities&lt;/span&gt; because my great-grandfather was home during the holiday.&lt;br /&gt;   Finding this information has taken years of searching through documents and collaborating with distant relatives.  Schweitzer's book makes finding many of these sources so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;   Starting with the war itself and providing the uninformed with a brief background and history from which to orient oneself, Schweitzer provides an overview of the various documents and histories available.  He then walks the reader through the various national and state archives that are available.  The next section deals with the various national and state publications followed by the numerous local resources that are available.  His section on the various military unit histories is extremely informational.  He closes with a discussion of artifact collections.&lt;br /&gt;   Whether you are just beginning your civil war research or you are an old hand, this is one book you should have in your library.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20159960-7088304013452971547?l=www.summittfamilyquarterly.org%2Fblog%2Fblog.htm' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/7088304013452971547/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20159960&amp;postID=7088304013452971547' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/7088304013452971547'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/7088304013452971547'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.summittfamilyquarterly.org/blog/2008/07/civil-war-genealogy-by-george-k.html' title='Civil War Genealogy by George K.

I'm also adding some content management software for the other information so that we can provide a better display of information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll also be placing audio and video files on the site soon as my oral history program I want to put into place will be added to this site.

As you know, she was a Summit descendant of Francis Summit (1826-1892) who ultimately settled in Sims, Montgomery County, Arkansas with his large family.  Her grandfather was William Haskell Summit, son of Francis and Emaline Shaffer, and the only son who did not make the trek to Arkansas with the rest of the family and stayed in Texas. I do not have to remind any of you about the importance of this wonderful lady to Summit(t)(Sammet) family history research.  I would like to have her obit placed on the Summitt Family Research website if someone can find it.  I may write a piece on her for posting, but I have to review my extensive file on her--no one knew it, but she refused to give me permission a number of years ago to write an article about her for the Summitt Family Quarterly, but I collected the information, including pictures, anyway.I thought all of you might wish to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul SummittNiceville, FL&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20159960-113647770750294903?l=www.summittfamilyquarterly.org%2Fblog%2Fblog.htm' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/113647770750294903/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20159960&amp;postID=113647770750294903' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/113647770750294903'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/113647770750294903'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.summittfamilyquarterly.org/blog/2006/01/la-rue-summit-williford.html' title='La Rue Summit Williford'/><author><name>Paul</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06468737972584722960</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='09876374073274467371'/></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20159960.post-113634969362404906</id><published>2006-01-03T20:40:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-01-03T20:44:09.343-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Dan Summitt's new book</title><content type='html'>Glen Summit added this posting to the Summit(t) Research Group on MSN on Dec. 22, 2005.  Thanks Glen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October 2004 Commander Charles Daniel Summitt had his book published by Texas A&amp;amp;M Press. Here is a summary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tales of a Cold War SubmarinerDan Summitt&lt;br /&gt;Though Dan Summitt retired from the U.S Navy years ago, he still regrets not receiving clearance to fill a submarine missile tube with thirty-five thousand pounds of wet grits and launch it at a very pesky Russian spy ship. In Tales of a Cold War Submariner, Summitt tells the story of hismilitary career, proving that navy life at the height of the Cold War ascommander of two nuclear submarines kept him on his toes. He relates his work with Adm. Hyman Rickover, recounts the efforts to stay undetected while patrolling for Soviet submarines, and sharesthe everyday dangers faced by a submarine crew. Summitt graduated from the Naval Academy in 1947, entered Submarine School, and rose to become deputy chief of staff for the commander of the Submarine Force Atlantic Fleet and chief of staff for the Submarine Flotilla 8. He served as commander of the USS Seadragon on its secret mission to the North Pole, where he rendezvoused with the USS Skate to conduct experiments under the ice. Summitt later took command of the USS Alexander Hamilton, one of forty-one Polaris-class nuclear submarines, which carried sixteen thirty-five-foot-tall missiles. Summitt takes the reader ona tour of this vessel, describing daily life and the routine and not-so-routine missions in close quarters with no outside contact for days or even months. Through it all, the fear of mechanical malfunctions, detection, or imminent attack always lingered. Summitt's anecdotes and descriptions capture this tense era in history.&lt;br /&gt;_________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;DAN SUMMITT retired in 1974 and now makes his home in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20159960-113634969362404906?l=www.summittfamilyquarterly.org%2Fblog%2Fblog.htm' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/113634969362404906/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20159960&amp;postID=113634969362404906' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/113634969362404906'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/113634969362404906'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.summittfamilyquarterly.org/blog/2006/01/dan-summitts-new-book.html' title='Dan Summitt&apos;s new book'/><author><name>Paul</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06468737972584722960</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='09876374073274467371'/></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20159960.post-113630513736551790</id><published>2006-01-03T07:28:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-01-03T08:18:57.386-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Civil War</title><content type='html'>Well the new year is upon us and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Man's Treason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; still isn't finished.  I have, however, started working on the book again.  Currently, I am doing research into the causes of the War and what the war should be called.  There are a large number of angry people still out there on both topics.  After re-reading some of my chapter I am of the opinion that this chapter will probably antagonize both sides of these issues but I also hope that it might make some readers think.  I really question if people think much anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've gotten a few emails recently from my Aunt Ruth, one of dad's older sisters, and am very pleased to hear from her and know she is doing so well.  She and my late uncle Carter stand as shining examples of what I sometimes wish I could emulate. They spent a good part of their lives as missionairies in Africa. I believe one of their daughters and her husband are over there now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the early part of December I received an email from a young lady who had read about Chad Everett Summitt having been shot in an article here on the SFQ site.  It seems she was a friend of his and had not spoken to him since 1998 and was wondering if he had survived.  I know no more today about Chad's shooting than I did the day that Glen Summit sent the article to me.  If anyone knows more please let me know so I can update these pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was also another message asking if there were any connections between the Summit(t)s and the Shumates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that's about it for now.  Good luck to everyone with the new year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;paul&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20159960-113630513736551790?l=www.summittfamilyquarterly.org%2Fblog%2Fblog.htm' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/113630513736551790/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20159960&amp;postID=113630513736551790' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/113630513736551790'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/113630513736551790'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.summittfamilyquarterly.org/blog/2006/01/civil-war.html' title='Civil War'/><author><name>Paul</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06468737972584722960</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='09876374073274467371'/></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20159960.post-113544537914065298</id><published>2005-12-24T09:26:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2005-12-24T12:47:26.923-08:00</updated><title type='text'>First things First</title><content type='html'>Well, it's Christmas Eve, 2005. We quit publishing the printed version of the Quarterly at the end of last year. I've decided to start publishing this blog about the family history here on the site instead. I miss writing about the family history and this seems to be one avenue of doing so again.&lt;br /&gt;     I recently received a set of pictures from Jack Summitt of Francis "Frank" Summitt and his sons.  As soon as I have a few minutes I'm going to clean these pictures up and post them here on the site for everyone to look at.&lt;br /&gt;     My goal is to update my GEDCOM file here on the site also.  I've been very disappointed with Family Tree Maker lately.  So much so that I have not bought the last couple of upgrades.  After the upgrade to Version 10 my file became corrupted and none of the fixes that the company help desk suggested worked.  So I've decided to try and get back to a clean version and export out to GEDCOM and then maintain my files in another application.  Not sure which one yet.&lt;br /&gt;     I also plan to get back to work on the Cardwell Cemetary Project soon.  This is a data entry job that just takes time.&lt;br /&gt;     Anyway, that's about all for today.  Merry Christmas to all of you and please feel free to drop me an email and let me know what you would like to see here on the site.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20159960-113544537914065298?l=www.summittfamilyquarterly.org%2Fblog%2Fblog.htm' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/113544537914065298/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20159960&amp;postID=113544537914065298' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/113544537914065298'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/20159960/posts/default/113544537914065298'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.summittfamilyquarterly.org/blog/2005/12/first-things-first.html' title='First things First'/><author><name>Paul</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06468737972584722960</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='09876374073274467371'/></author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
