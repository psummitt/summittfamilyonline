Daddy died last night about 8 PM.  He waited for Janet & Fielden to get here
<BR>
and died about 5 minutes later.  I think he waited for them.  We're going to
<BR>
the funeral home sometime today to set the times for everything and will let
<BR>
you know soon after.
<BR>

<BR>
Daddy was at home when he died and we made him as comfortable as we could
<BR>
toward the end.  He never had any pain except for the labored breathing
<BR>
which I know was hard work for him.  He did not lay in bed as an invalid for
<BR>
any length of time for which we are all thankful.  I believe the Lord tried
<BR>
to honor his wishes in that respect.  Daddy was just as sweet as he could be
<BR>
through the whole ordeal.  He was a good example even in death.
<BR>

<BR>
The rest of our family appreciates so much all the concern everyone has
<BR>
shown.  We all felt the love pouring out -- and so did Daddy.  I'm so glad
<BR>
he had Friday and Saturday.  Those days were good for him and he saw so many
<BR>
people he loved dearly.  He was making sure everyone had their picture made
<BR>
with him Saturday.
<BR>

<BR>
We will all miss him, but we know where he is and in whose hands he is.  And
<BR>
that is such a comfort.
<BR>

<BR>
Love,
<BR>
Sandra

<BR>
William Knox Summitt was born in Cardwell, Missouri, on February 26, 1904, the middle of three sons of John Franklin Summitt, an early settler of Dunklin County and a founder of the Antioch Church of Christ located a few miles outside Cardwell.  His older half brother by John Franklin's first wife, Minnie L. Taylor (who died September 4, 1902), was named James Euel born March 6, 1902 in Cardwell and his younger brother, Robert Paul was born October 11, 1906, also in Cardwell.  He also had a younger sister named Mabel M. who was born September 29, 1908 in Cardwell and died June 1, 1911.  His mother was Eugennie Darden, John Franklin's second wife. John Franklin and Eugennie were married May 3, 1903 in Senath, Missouri by S. F. Green, minister, and witnessed by A. K. Edwards and a Dr. Chaney.  Eugennie died February 13, 1910.  William Knox and his brothers were largely raised by John Franklin and his third wife, Mary ElizabethDarden, Eugennie's stepmother.  No children were born to the last marriage. 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
The John Franklin Summitt family moved to Henderson, Tennessee around 1918 for the purpose of providing a college level education for the children.  John Franklin died shortly thereafter on February 22, 1920 of the flu and pneumonia.  He was buried in Henderson, Tennessee.  His estate was probated 
<BR>
in Dunklin County where he was domiciled and owned land.  
<BR>

<BR>
William Knox went on with his education, graduating from Union University in 1925 with a degree in social studies, from George Peabody College in 1928 with a Master's Degree, and from the University of Missouri in 1933 with a Doctor's Degree in Education.  
<BR>

<BR>
While at the University of Missouri in Columbia, he met Alevia Maurine Burch, analready experience elementary school teacher.  They were married in Branson, Missouri on August 12, 1931.      Maurine Burch was born November 21, 1905 in Columbia, Missouri, to WilliamC layton Burch and Priscilla Hunton.  Not much is known about the Burch family except that Clayton and his siblings were born in Oklahoma Indian territory between 1880 and 1900 to Paul B. Burch and his wife, Nettie, thought to have 
<BR>
been a full-blooded Indian.  The Paul B. Burch family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas before the turn of the century and Clayton graduated from Fort Smith High School in 1904.  Clayton enrolled as a freshman at the University of Missouri in Columbia in September 1904.  While a student at the University of 
<BR>
Missouri, Clayton met and married Priscilla Hunton on March 5, 1905 in Columbia (Boone County).  The situation did not work out and Clayton left for California at the end of the school year in what turned out to be a permanent separation so Maurine never met or knew her father.  Priscilla and Clayton corresponded over the next few years while Clayton was residing in Los Angeles, including communications about Maurine.  During this time, Priscilla sent Clayton a picture of herself and Maurine.  By 1907 Priscilla
<BR>
had decided to get a divorce and remarry.  Priscilla married Orlando Irvin in 1908 and Maurine was raised thinking that she was an Irvin. She learned that she was a Burch when a collateral relative let it slip that she was a child of this early marriage between Priscilla and Clayton Burch.
<BR>

<BR>
Priscilla Hunton was the daughter of John Henry Hunton and Eliza Ellen Coffey. The Huntons came from England before the turn of the century.  Eliza Ellen Coffey descends from a long line of Coffeys going back at least into the mid-1700s in Wilkes County, North Carolina, and possibly early Virginia.  
<BR>

<BR>
William Knox and MaurineSummitt had three sons--William Weston (July 15,1932),  twins, James Knox and Paul Clayton (December 5, 1934)--who grew up in Searcy, Arkansas, served in the military, and graduated from Harding College before pursuing advanced professional education (doctor of dentistry, doctor of medicine, and attorney,respectively).  Except for wives and children, their story is mostly left to a future date.
<BR>

<BR>
After William Knox obtained his PhD in 1933, he joined the faculty of Harding College, at Searcy, a position he would continue the rest of his life except for a short depression era stint with the CCC.  During that time as a member of the Harding faculty, he taught in the fields of education and psychology, served 
<BR>
as registrar of the college from 1940 to 1960, and became chairman of the Departments Education and Psychology in 1960.  At various points, he was vice president of the local field chapter of Phi Delta Kappa, and held membership in the National Education Association, American Association of School 
<BR>
Administrators, American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Offices, Arkansas Psychological Association, Arkansas Education Association, Department of Higher Education of the National Education Association.
<BR>

<BR>
He was a dedicated ambassador between the College and the Searcy community, devoting much time to Boy Scouts work and civic work, including long active membership in the Kiwanis Club.  He was one of the primary supporters for the establishment of camp Wyldwood outside Searcy and served as chairman of its Board.  He also served as  deacon at the College Church of Christ.
<BR>

<BR>
Throughout his life, William Knox Summitt maintained his contacts with Cardwell, Missouri and the Antioch Church of Christ founded by his father.  He inherited some farm land from his father and bought other land in the vicinity of Cardwell--totaling about 120 acres--and frequently visited the area.  His two brothers, Euel and Paul, lived and farmed around Cardwell most of their lives, were active in church and educational affairs and raised families there.  Euel moved to Memphis later in life, but never really 
<BR>
severed his Cardwell ties.  
<BR>

<BR>
William Knox Summitt was killed by a hit and run driver in New Orleans,Louisiana on October 3, 1965 while attending a regional meeting of the Quapaw Area Council of Boy Scouts.  He is buried in the White County Memorial Cemetery, Searcy, Arkansas.  The driver was never found.
<BR>

<BR>
Maurine Summitt had an early driving ambition to be a school teacher, a profession she started almost right out of high school.  She was a life long partner of  William Knox in his professional and civic activities, in raising three sons, and in pursuing an elementary teaching career in Missouri and 
<BR>
Arkansas public schools.  She was educated at Missouri State Teachers College, the University of Missouri, and Harding College (Bachelor's degree in 1955) and taught in Searcy area schools of Pangburn, Kennsett, Bald Knob, and West Point.  She specialized in first grade level teaching and was 
<BR>
consider an expert reading teacher.  She continued to live at 200 Grand Avenue, Searcy, Arkansas until September 1999, at which time she sold the home place to Harding University and moved to Anacoco, Lousiana to live with her eldest son and his wife, Bill and Betty Summitt.    She celebrates her 
<BR>
94th birthday on November 21, 1999.

While at the University of Missouri in Columbia, he met Alevia Maurine Burch, analready experience elementary school teacher.  They were married in Branson, Missouri on August 12, 1931.      Maurine Burch was born November 21, 1905 in Columbia, Missouri, to WilliamC layton Burch and Priscilla Hunton.  Not much is known about the Burch family except that Clayton and his siblings were born in Oklahoma Indian territory between 1880 and 1900 to Paul B. Burch and his wife, Nettie, thought to have
<BR>
been a full-blooded Indian.  The Paul B. Burch family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas before the turn of the century and Clayton graduated from Fort Smith High School in 1904.  Clayton enrolled as a freshman at the University of Missouri in Columbia in September 1904.  While a student at the University of
<BR>
Missouri, Clayton met and married Priscilla Hunton on March 5, 1905 in Columbia (Boone County).  The situation did not work out and Clayton left for California at the end of the school year in what turned out to be a permanent separation so Maurine never met or knew her father.  Priscilla and Clayton corresponded over the next few years while Clayton was residing in Los Angeles, including communications about Maurine.  During this time, Priscilla sent Clayton a picture of herself and Maurine.  By 1907 Priscilla
<BR>
had decided to get a divorce and remarry.  Priscilla married Orlando Irvin in 1908 and Maurine was raised thinking that she was an Irvin. She learned that she was a Burch when a collateral relative let it slip that she was a child of this early marriage between Priscilla and Clayton Burch.
<BR>

<BR>
Priscilla Hunton was the daughter of John Henry Hunton and Eliza Ellen Coffey. The Huntons came from England before the turn of the century.  Eliza Ellen Coffey descends from a long line of Coffeys going back at least into the mid-1700s in Wilkes County, North Carolina, and possibly early Virginia.

<BR>
William Knox and MaurineSummitt had three sons--William Weston (July 15,1932),  twins, James Knox and Paul Clayton (December 5, 1934)--who grew up in Searcy, Arkansas, served in the military, and graduated from Harding College before pursuing advanced professional education (doctor of dentistry, doctor of medicine, and attorney,respectively).  Except for wives and children, their story is mostly left to a future date.
<BR>

<BR>
After William Knox obtained his PhD in 1933, he joined the faculty of Harding College, at Searcy, a position he would continue the rest of his life except for a short depression era stint with the CCC.  During that time as a member of the Harding faculty, he taught in the fields of education and psychology, served
<BR>
as registrar of the college from 1940 to 1960, and became chairman of the Departments Education and Psychology in 1960.  At various points, he was vice president of the local field chapter of Phi Delta Kappa, and held membership in the National Education Association, American Association of School
<BR>
Administrators, American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Offices, Arkansas Psychological Association, Arkansas Education Association, Department of Higher Education of the National Education Association.
<BR>

<BR>
He was a dedicated ambassador between the College and the Searcy community, devoting much time to Boy Scouts work and civic work, including long active membership in the Kiwanis Club.  He was one of the primary supporters for the establishment of camp Wyldwood outside Searcy and served as chairman of its Board.  He also served as  deacon at the College Church of Christ.
<BR>

<BR>
Throughout his life, William Knox Summitt maintained his contacts with Cardwell, Missouri and the Antioch Church of Christ founded by his father.  He inherited some farm land from his father and bought other land in the vicinity of Cardwell--totaling about 120 acres--and frequently visited the area.  His two brothers, Euel and Paul, lived and farmed around Cardwell most of their lives, were active in church and educational affairs and raised families there.  Euel moved to Memphis later in life, but never really
<BR>
severed his Cardwell ties.
<BR>

<BR>
William Knox Summitt was killed by a hit and run driver in New Orleans,Louisiana on October 3, 1965 while attending a regional meeting of the Quapaw Area Council of Boy Scouts.  He is buried in the White County Memorial Cemetery, Searcy, Arkansas.  The driver was never found.
<BR>

<BR>
Maurine Summitt had an early driving ambition to be a school teacher, a profession she started almost right out of high school.  She was a life long partner of  William Knox in his professional and civic activities, in raising three sons, and in pursuing an elementary teaching career in Missouri and
<BR>
Arkansas public schools.  She was educated at Missouri State Teachers College, the University of Missouri, and Harding College (Bachelor's degree in 1955) and taught in Searcy area schools of Pangburn, Kennsett, Bald Knob, and West Point.  She specialized in first grade level teaching and was
<BR>
consider an expert reading teacher.  She continued to live at 200 Grand Avenue, Searcy, Arkansas until September 1999, at which time she sold the home place to Harding University and moved to Anacoco, Lousiana to live with her eldest son and his wife, Bill and Betty Summitt.    She celebrates her
<BR>
94th birthday on November 21, 1999.

Glen & Paul Moody, I am guessing that the article referring to Squire J.T. 
<BR>
Summit was a reference to James Lee Summit(t).  He was the patriarch of all 
<BR>
of the Summit(t)s in Dyer County from about the 1870s to after 1920.  Capital 
<BR>
"T" and "L" are often transcribed wrong.  Again, I am just guessing.  I 
<BR>
suspect a little research would turn up the Summit(t)s living close to 
<BR>
Bruceville and  would confirm this guess.  Paul Moody is the expert on this 
<BR>
group of Summit(t)s.  Anyhow, great hunnting Glen.

<BR>
Paul;
<BR>
The reference Glen is making is to great -grandfather James Lee Summitt. The barn on the old home place did burn down in the early 1900's and was rebuilt by our grandfather Chester A. Summitt sometime in the early 1940's. The barn was very well rebuilt with cypress wood using clinched nails and an extremely deep concrete footing. It stood until a few years ago. It is interesting to know that GGF James L. was referred to as a squire. I am going to Dyersburg this week and will see if I can find any record as to why the reference was used. I'm thinking that it might have been an insinuation on the part of the paper as a possible reference of respect to his community involvement at the time.

Story as told by Paul M. Summitt - James was a preacher for the Church of Christ.  He established about 19 Churches in his lifetime.  There is a place near Dyersburg, TN that is named Summit Church after James Lee. The story is told by the Church members that James Lee began preaching on a tree stump.  As he preached the congregation bulit the Church around him.  The Church still stands with the stump inside and the preachers still stand on the stump to preach.[GlenScott.FTW]

Glen & Paul Moody, I am guessing that the article referring to Squire J.T.
<BR>
Summit was a reference to James Lee Summit(t).  He was the patriarch of all
<BR>
of the Summit(t)s in Dyer County from about the 1870s to after 1920. Capital
<BR>
"T" and "L" are often transcribed wrong.  Again, I am just guessing.  I
<BR>
suspect a little research would turn up the Summit(t)s living close to
<BR>
Bruceville and  would confirm this guess.  Paul Moody is the expert on this
<BR>
group of Summit(t)s.  Anyhow, great hunnting Glen.

<BR>
Paul;
<BR>
The reference Glen is making is to great -grandfather James Lee Summitt. The barn on the old home place did burn down in the early 1900's and was rebuilt by our grandfather Chester A. Summitt sometime in the early 1940's. The barn was very well rebuilt with cypress wood using clinched nails and an extremely deep concrete footing. It stood until a few years ago. It is interesting to know that GGF James L. was referred to as a squire. I am going to Dyersburg this week and will see if I can find any record as to why the reference was used. I'm thinking that it might have been an insinuation on the part of the paper as a possible reference of respect to his community involvement at the time.

Paul C Summit went to the Senate Judiciary Committee after a decade in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice to join the staff of the Subcommittee on Criminal Law and Procedures chaired by Senator McClellan (AR).  Within a few months, he became the Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee.  Both Senators Kennedy and Thurmond were members of the Subcommittee, he worked closely with them on
<BR>
criminal law issues. 
<BR>

<BR>
After Senator McClellan died in November 1977, he sort of stayed in limbo for the rest of that Congress as the new chairman of the subcommittee (Senator Biden) brought on his own staff.  By happenstance, Senator Eastland (MS), chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, decided to retire at the end of 1978 and Ted Kennedy became the chairman and Senator Thurmond the ranking republican. 
<BR>

<BR>
Kennedy asked him to handle criminal law issues for him on the full committee staff, but, of course, he also worked closely with Thurmond.   According to Paul Clayton Summit, he felt Kennedy was liberal on most things, but basically conservative on criminal law issues (within reason).   As you may recall, the republicans won the Senate in 1980 and Senator Thurmond succeeded Kennedy as chairman.  Thurmond simply asked him to stay on the full committee staff to continue to handle criminal law issues.  Over the years, he became very close to almost all of the Senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee and many congressman on the House Judiciary Committee.  He describes himself as a republican--conservative on almost everything except human/civil rights and perhaps environment.

Following taken from E-Mail dated 7/28/1999 from Paul C Summitt: "...The death of John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife and sister-in-law broke my heart.  I may have told you, I used to work for Senator Ted Kennedy and know him well.  I am also a pilot and know exactly what happened to John F.

Hello,
<BR>

<BR>
I did a search on my ancester, Rebecca Stonecipher born 1824, and arrived at your website. You have information about her father, Ezra, but little about her, so I am unclear regarding the connection. But her husband (briefly) was Martin Williams son of Mattias Williams, so I am wondering if there is another connection with her niece, Mary Dow Stonecipher, married to William Mathias Williams. I happen to live in Minneapolis, so I am intrigued by all of the possible connections. I am also trying to learn more about Rebecca who became a single mother with three kids under 5 when her husband married someone else in 1848. Thanks for any suggestions!

Knoxville, May 22, 1863
<BR>
Hon. George Brown,
<BR>
Judge of the Third Judicial Circuit of Tennessee:
<BR>
Respondent John E. Toole for answer and return to your honor's writ of habea corpus issued upon the petition of Stephen McKee, Michael Malone, and Jonathan Summit would respectfully state and show unto your honor that the statement of the petitioners that they are restrained of their liberty upon a charge of the murder of John Cunningham, who was a citizen of Monroe County, &c., is wholly untrue and without foundation. Petitioners were not arrested and have not been held upon the charge of John Cunningham.
<BR>
Respondent here begs leave to submit to your honor a full and correct statement of facts as to the manner in which petitioners came into the custody of respondent:
<BR>
On the 3d of this month Col. G. Troup Maxwell, an officer of the C.S. Army, commandant of the post of Loudon, Tenn., sent said petitioners as prisoners under guard to respondent as provost-marshal for the Department of East Tennessee charged with disloyalty and treason against the Government of the Confederate States in harboring and feeding a band of bushwhackers who were committin acts of violence upon the citizens of Monroe County, Tenn., and in discharge of my duty as a subordinate officer of the Confederate Army and in obedience to general orders and instructions from the commanding general of the Department of East Tennessee said petitioners were committed to the military prison at Knoxville to await such further disposition as the Confederate authorities might make in the premises. Afterwards, to wit, on the 12th instant Michael Malone, one of said petitioners, was released from custody upon my application and permitted to return home, and a few days since after the service of the writ upon me petitioners Stephen McKee and Jonathan Summit were arrested and taken out of the custody of the military authorities by the C. S. marshal for the District of East Tennessee upon a warrent for treason issued by Confederate Commissioner Elliott. Consequently none of said petitioners are in my custody or under my control or the control of the military authorities, but are in the custory and under the control of the civil officers of the Confederate Government, and for this reason I have no power or authority to have the bodies of the petitioners before your honor at Sweet Water Depot on the 23d instant as directed and required in your honor's writ.
<BR>
Now, having made full answer and return of my doings in the premises I pray to be hense dismissed.

From Paul C. Summitt's notes: burial place is unknown but she probably died on the family farm in southern Loudon County and was buried in the St. Paul Lutheran Old Cemetery where Jonathan was buried. A tombstone has not been found. The entry September 13, 1902 age 86 years 2 months 12 days was taken from a family bible and appears to be a tombstone inscription format.

Notes for JACOB ESABIAS SUMMITT:
<BR>
1.  The given name of Summitt/Sumit/Summet/Summett varies considerably from census to census.  He first appeared in the 1840 Tennessee census as "Esavias Sumit" in Monroe County; he was between 20-30 years of age, his wife was in the same age bracket and they had two daughters.  "Eurebius Summett", age 31, appeared in Monroe County, Tennessee in the 1850 census with wife Sarah (28).   "Esarbius Summet" (40) appeared in the 1860 Monroe County, Tennessee census with wife Sarah (33).  Daniel is known to have settled in Greene County, Tennessee and remained there at least through 1870, while his parents had moved on to ??  The "Summitt" family could not be found in the 1870 census, either in Tennessee or Arkansas.

Following is an Email from Paul M Summitt dated July 7, 1999 
<BR>

<BR>
"As you will see, on page 9 of the July 99 issue is information copied from a page from what we believe to be Betty S. Butler Summit's family bible (in my possession). The information reads (to the best of our ability todecipher) "J. Eusavious Summit was born the 10 of February 1815." In what we believe to be Jonathan Summit's family bible (in Paul C. Summitt's possession) the information reads "Esabious Summit was born the 10 day of February 1815."
<BR>

<BR>
I'm note really sure where I first saw the Jacob used with this name and my notes are of no assistance there. Someone one told me that Eusabius (in whatever form) meant "Jesus saves us all." Very romantic but I've foundnothing to support that either.
<BR>

<BR>
2. As far as how the Summitt Family stands on the issue . . . <VBG> I guess we'll have to ask them. As the self appointed editor and publisher of the Summitt Family Quarterly, I try to use the same spellings that are in the original documents and when possible point out the discrepancies.
<BR>

<BR>
Whatever the spelling, we know that this man was born Feb 10, 1815 and that he was Daniel's brother, Francis' son.  Sorry I can't be of any more help in clarifying this more.
<BR>

<BR>
I hope everyone enjoys the scanned images of the pages from the bibles in this issue.

<BR>
Paul,
<BR>

<BR>
I have been digging through just about everything I have on Eusabius/Eusebius Summitt and have a couple of perplexing questions.
<BR>

<BR>
1.  I have reviewed all my back issues of the Summitt Family Quarterly and all the documents we located in Greene and Monroe Counties, TN.  I cannot find a single documentary reference to the forename Jacob.  I know Paul C. referenced the birth of Jacob Eusabius in his articles on Daniel Summitt
<BR>
and in his research in Greene County.  Is there a document or record that identifies his forename?
<BR>

<BR>
2.  There are several court records from Monroe County that spell his name EusAbius.  These include the probate of the estate of Sarah Moser Summitt (he was administrator), the probate of Jeremiah Boyd's estate (he was co-executor), his own will, Codicile, and estate settlement (dated April 1893).  I will discount the census entries since a lot of the time they depended on the spelling capabilities of the census taker or the information was provided by a second person.  However, the court documents
<BR>
give strong evidence that his name was spelled with an 'A'.  I am not sure of the time period he served as Justice of the Peace, since we have not found any court records to date referencing him in this position.  I am sure that there are at least a couple documents in existence that spell his name with an 'E'.  What is the Summitt family stand on this question?
<BR>

<BR>
Thanks, Roger
<BR>
*****************************************************************************************
<BR>
Email from Paul C Summitt "Variously spelled but most common as Eusebius 
<BR>
or Eusabius Summit.  Some have cited the name as Jacob Eusebius Summit(t).  
<BR>
Unfortunately, his tombstone is simply "E. Summitt" (note the two "t"s) and 
<BR>
his wife's tombstone has the same notation (she died a few years before he 
<BR>
did).  I suspect that this man spelled his last name with one "t" most of his 
<BR>
life, but by the 1890s may have adopted two "t"s.
<BR>

<BR>
This may not be enlightening, but I have adopted the name "Jacob Eusebius".  
<BR>
Like Paul Moody, I try my best to reflect the spelling in the particular 
<BR>
document or record and sometimes I may not note the variations.  The reasons 
<BR>
for my preference of "Jacob Eusebius" are not many.  
<BR>

<BR>
First, living great grandchildren note his name as "Jacob Eusebius".  I am 
<BR>
particularly impressed with the family knowledge of Flora Mae Summitt Keene 
<BR>
of Knoxville, TN, a long time Summitt researcher, daughter of Murray Summitt, 
<BR>
who was a son of Martin Luther Summitt, who was the favorite son of Eusebius 
<BR>
Summit(t).  Family tradition may have some significance in this long-living 
<BR>
family.  Murray Summitt was six years old when Eusebius died and lived to the 
<BR>
ripe old age of about 92.  Flora Mae was nine years old when Martin Luther 
<BR>
died in 1927.  I am also impressed with James Bruce Summitt of San Antonio, a 
<BR>
great grandson and member of the Sons of the American Revolution, who also 
<BR>
uses Jacob Eusebius.  It might also be noted that Daniel Summit, Eusebius' 
<BR>
father, had an older brother named Jacob who was still alive when Eusebius 
<BR>
was born in North Carolina.  For all we know, that brother may have been both 
<BR>
the source of the Jacob and the source of the Eusebius.  Nobody makes up a 
<BR>
name like that.  In addition, there are children in various Summit(t) lines 
<BR>
named Jacob Eusebius/Eusabius that one might suspect are named after this 
<BR>
man.  
<BR>

<BR>
Second, I believe some of the confusion on the proper spelling has come from 
<BR>
the nickname of "Sabe" that followed Eusebius and some of his namesakes.  I 
<BR>
once visited with Murray Summitt and he told me Eusebius was known as "Big 
<BR>
Sabe".  One knowing of this "handle" would naturally assume that the name was 
<BR>
spelled "Eusabius".
<BR>

<BR>
Third, the family bible of Eusebius in the possession of Flora Mae Summitt 
<BR>
Keene spells the name "Eusebius".  Unfortunately, the bible does not include 
<BR>
the name "Jacob" or an initial.
<BR>

<BR>
Fourth, transcripts of the Old St. Paul Lutheran Church records--Eusebius was 
<BR>
both Elder and Secretary of this church for many years--consistently spells 
<BR>
the name as "Eusebius" numerous times in both referring to the original man 
<BR>
and several namesakes.
<BR>

<BR>
Roger, I do have a copy of the court record appointing Eusebius as a Justice 
<BR>
of the Peace, but as usual I am not able to lay my hand on it right off--but 
<BR>
there is one.  I do not recall how his name was spelled, but these are court 
<BR>
clerk transcription that are notorious for phonetic spelling of names.  You 
<BR>
find similar defects in probate stuff.  Incidentally, do you have a copy of 
<BR>
Eusebius' will with his signature?  I bet it is around.
<BR>

<BR>
For what it is worth, Eusebius researchers are not the only ones plagued with 
<BR>
these questions.  Eusebius' brother Francis Summit (note the one "t") by 
<BR>
family tradition  of descendants in Montgomery County (Sims), Arkansas is 
<BR>
known as "John Francis Summit" but no one can find any documentation for 
<BR>
this--apart from the tradition and the suspicion that he might have been 
<BR>
named after his grandfather John Francis Summit.  Francis also did us the 
<BR>
favor of naming a son whose descendants list him as Jacob Eusabius Summit 
<BR>
(note the "a" and the fact that he was also known as "Sabe").  Oh, well.  
<BR>
Just enjoy the process and do not get to upset.

Most of the information on the Fowler surname came from Quaker records and a great deal of this research was done many years ago by Larue Williford from Houston, Tx. 
<BR>

<BR>
If anyone can help me out on my Fowler family it will be greatly appreciated and I also have additional information on the children of David Crockett Guill & Marinda Catherine Fowler. I descend through James Montgomery and Beulah Benton Guill.

Most of the information on the Fowler surname came from Quaker records and a great deal of this research was done many years ago by Larue Williford from Houston, Tx.
<BR>

<BR>
If anyone can help me out on my Fowler family it will be greatly appreciated and I also have additional information on the children of David Crockett Guill & Marinda Catherine Fowler. I descend through James Montgomery and Beulah Benton Guill.

<BR>

<BR>
Paul Moody, as you know I am trying to put together something for the next
<BR>
newsletter on the James W. Pardue family.  For those unfamiliar with this
<BR>
family, my great great grandfather Jonathan and Bettie Butler Summit had
<BR>
three children--James Lee, Nancy Jane, and Mary M.  Nancy Jane married James
<BR>
W. Pardue on April 2, 1860.  This was to be a tragic senario.  Both James W.
<BR>
and Nancy Jane were dead by the end of the Civil War.  Jonathan and Bettie
<BR>
took in and raised their two children--Martha Jane and James McClellan
<BR>
Pardue.  I just recently came in touch with Betty Keirn, a granddaughter of
<BR>
James McClellan Pardue, who is kindly furnishing information to me on this
<BR>
family.
<BR>

<BR>
Betty Keirn tells that James W. Pardue enlisted as a private in Company C. of
<BR>
the 37the regiment of the Tennessee Infantry, Confederate Army, in May 1863
<BR>
(source:  Betty Keirn and National Archives).  The Prisoner of War list from
<BR>
the Office of the Provost Marshal General, Union Army of Ohio, Knoxville, TN
<BR>
has him "arrested at Athens, in McMinn Co. October 26, 1864 - stealing.  Died
<BR>
Mil. Hosp. Feb. 10, 1865 at Knoxville."  Betty Keirns informs me that she is
<BR>
unable to find his grave.  On the other hand, an old letter from James
<BR>
McClellan Pardue (son of James W.) notes that James W. "is buried in the
<BR>
National Cemetery in Knoxville."  Apparently, James W. and Nancy Jane died
<BR>
within a few months of each other.  
<BR>

<BR>
Betty Keirn is very interested in locating James W. Pardue's burial site.
<BR>
She has apparently spent a lot of effort and has been unsuccessful so far.
<BR>
I would like to fill in more details on his service and his POW
<BR>
status/experience.  Any information would be appreciated.  Paul Moody, I
<BR>
think maybe your CD covers Confederate soldiers taken into Union custody.
<BR>
Anyway, help me out.
<BR>

<BR>
In the meantime, I will work on the other parts of the Pardue family history.

W. Pardue on April 2, 1860.  This was to be a tragic senario.  Both James W.
<BR>
and Nancy Jane were dead by the end of the Civil War.  Jonathan and Bettie
<BR>
took in and raised their two children--Martha Jane and James McClellan
<BR>
Pardue.  I just recently came in touch with Betty Keirn, a granddaughter of
<BR>
James McClellan Pardue, who is kindly furnishing information to me on this
<BR>
family.
<BR>

<BR>
Betty Keirn tells that James W. Pardue enlisted as a private in Company C. of
<BR>
the 37the regiment of the Tennessee Infantry, Confederate Army, in May 1863
<BR>
(source:  Betty Keirn and National Archives).  The Prisoner of War list from
<BR>
the Office of the Provost Marshal General, Union Army of Ohio, Knoxville, TN
<BR>
has him "arrested at Athens, in McMinn Co. October 26, 1864 - stealing. Died
<BR>
Mil. Hosp. Feb. 10, 1865 at Knoxville."  Betty Keirns informs me that she is
<BR>
unable to find his grave.  On the other hand, an old letter from James
<BR>
McClellan Pardue (son of James W.) notes that James W. "is buried in the
<BR>
National Cemetery in Knoxville."  Apparently, James W. and Nancy Jane died
<BR>
within a few months of each other.
<BR>

<BR>
Betty Keirn is very interested in locating James W. Pardue's burial site.
<BR>
She has apparently spent a lot of effort and has been unsuccessful so far.
<BR>
I would like to fill in more details on his service and his POW
<BR>
status/experience.  Any information would be appreciated.  Paul Moody, I
<BR>
think maybe your CD covers Confederate soldiers taken into Union custody.
<BR>
Anyway, help me out.
<BR>

<BR>
In the meantime, I will work on the other parts of the Pardue family history.

"Pat Cloninger, it may not be a land mystery to you, but your explanation casts some new light (for me) on the early Francis Summit (1741-1818) family who settled on Leepers creek we believe around 1769 and moved over to Lyles Creek close to St. John Lutheran in 1802.  Francis Summit sold his Leepers 
<BR>
Creek 300 acres to Alexander Brevard and Joseph Graham in 1806 for $319.00 (Book 21, page 586).  The land then joined land already owned by Brevard and Graham and land ownd by Peter Forney and Richard Rosdell.  Francis Summit had purchased the first 150 acres from Charles and Robert Abernathy according to this 1806 deed in 1789 and acquired the second 150 acres by North Carolina patent in 1789.  There is some confusion over when the Abernathys conveyed the property to Francis Summit since the grantee/grantor indexes list the date as 1769.  As far as I know, no one has ever been able to locate the 
<BR>
actual deed, though there are at least two deed book cites reflected in the records.  One cite is Book 4, page 55.  Other evidence indicates that Francis Summit's eldest child, Christian, was born in North Carlina in May 1769, I have leaned toward 1769 as the year of conveyance from the Abernathys.
<BR>

<BR>
Pat, I take it that this Francis Summit land probably was also locate in the vicinity of Ore Bank.  If so, would it have been located in current Lincoln County or is there a possibility it could have been located in the area now covered by Gaston County? 
<BR>

<BR>
All of this raises several questions in my mind.  When and how did the Abernathys obtain the land they sold to Francis Summit?  Where is the deed supposedly in Book 4, page 55 conveying the land to Francis Summit?  Since we know the family was Lutheran, what Lutheran church did they associate with?  
<BR>
And, if we know the probable Lutheran church, are there any extant church record?  Pat, would you have any thoughts on these questions?

There is no land mystery.  The Men started the Iron industry in Lincoln County.  They needed acres and acres of pine trees to make charcoal for their Iron furnaces.  In the area of which you speak they owned three furnaces and according to the records they were quite productive so therefore they had to cut many acres of pine trees to make charcoal.  Thay paid because the land was where they needed the wood.   Why was there a place called ORE BANK?   Lincoln County was blessed with deposits of Iron ore.
<BR>
The remains are still available because they were constructed with stone so big you wonder how they moved them without the use of bull-dozers and other earth moving equipment.  How do you think Davidson College was founded?  Iron money.

This should solve your mystery.

It is stated that the Summitts, Stines and Grounds came to Indiana abt 1827 and founded the St. John Luthern Church ( same name as church in NC ,) services were held in the homes.  The first bldg was built about 1835 on land provided by Christian for the sum of $ 4 and 371/2 cents .  It was a two story log church with weather board siding.  It had a unique semi-circular arrangement on both  the first and second levels to permit speaking to both levels from a central location in the long south wall.  Apparently controversy within the community resulted in a severed connection with the Lutheran Church in the early 1900's and became known as the Old Dutch Church reflecting the German community making up the membership and it is noted the Church shall never have connections to organized Religions.  The stone foundation of the orginal building still stands.

some information obtained from 1850 census, NC, Catawba County, Reel 624, page 140
<BR>
1850 census lists Francis's occupation as Farmer
<BR>
----------------------
<BR>
From Glen Summit's notes on the Summitt Family Quarterly Discussion dated 3Mar1999 
<BR>
"The Heritage of Rowan County, North Carolina, Volume 1, 1991."
<BR>
The following is from descendant article number 822 on page 555.
<BR>
"Elizabeth Shook married Francis Summit ca 1804 and they had several children. The only ones known are John 1805, Alexander 1812, James J. 1813, Julia Ann 1830, Marcus 1836, and Vina 1838. More than likely, there were others. Only Elizabeth and Francis appear in the 1850 census of Catawa County." This was written by Shela We . . .  and she gives her sources as census records, family records, family history, vital records, marriage and church records.
<BR>

<BR>
We know that the marriage date indicated is wrong, the marriage bond is clearly dated January 19, 1809. John b. 1805, as far as I know was the son of Jacob. Alexander is a pleasant surprise, I have always thought he was either a son of Jacob or Francis. The remainder of the children do show up on census records for Francis.
<BR>

<BR>
The 1810 North Carolina Census for Francis simply lists 1 male under ten, one male between 16 and 26, one female between 16 and 26.
<BR>
The 1820 North Carolina Census lists 2 sons under ten; 1 male between 25 and 45; 4 females under ten; 1 female between 26 and 45. Also 1 male slave is listed between the age of 14 and 26.
<BR>
The 1830 Indiana census shows Francis Jr in Knox county, but he is back in Catawa County, North Carolina according to the 1850 census with four children. So it seems the early census information indicates that it is possible for Alexander to be the son of Francis. Maybe this is a clue that we could follow up with more research.

1820 - Francis Summit (younger), Lincoln County, North Carolina.  2 males under 10 years; 1 male 26 to under 45 years; 4 females under 10 years; 1 female 26 to under 45 years.  1820 Census, Lincoln County, Roll 83, page 394. Also 1 male slave is listed between the age of fourteen and twenty-six.
<BR>

<BR>
The 1830 Indiana Census show Francis Jr in Knox County without his wife, but he is back in Catawba County, North Carolina according to the 1850 Census with four children and no wife again. Note: An Elizabeth Summit is listed in the 1850 Census living under the roof of Daniel and Cassandra Smyer, farmers. The census lists her age as 63. This may be the separated wife of Francis Summit.

<BR>

<BR>
We know that the marriage indicated is wrong, the marriage bond is clearly dated January 19, 1809. John b. 1805, is the son of Jacob Summit and Polly Cloninger, as proven by John's second Marriage License. Alexander is a surprise, I have always thought he was either a son of Jacob or Francis, again caution should be taken here, and I suspect Alexander is actually a son of Jacob. However, the remainder of the children do show up on census records for Francis.

E-mail from Dan Summit 3/5/1999: 
<BR>

<BR>
"Glen ,I know it sounds a little far fetched but I talked with new found cousins in Kings Mountain, NC.  This was almost a year ago.
<BR>

<BR>
They were doing Summitt research as well. (They are not on line) Their grandmother told them emphatically that "John was a scoundrel" and some of Francis and Elizabeth's children were actually fathered by John.  I am not offering this as proof because it is second hand information and I
<BR>
could not locate the source of her information.
<BR>

<BR>
I have two bits of information regarding Henry's father (and that's about all it's worth)
<BR>
1. The Rev. Linn's article naming John as the father of Henry
<BR>
2. The marriage license of Henry and Amanda naming Daniel as Henry's father.
<BR>

<BR>
I am not prepared to rule out any of the son's of Johanne's as the father at this time, although Francis, John and Jacob are the most likely. If John really was a scoundrel, this might account for Henry listing Daniel as his father at the time of his second marriage. Pure speculation on my part. Later Dan"

<BR>

<BR>
This is Elizabeth Summit age 63 listed in the 1850 Catawba County census in the household of Daniel Smyersen age 63 and a Catherine Smyer Senior age 49.  The last name "Smyer" is difficult to read. This is most likely Elizabeth Shook Summitt who was the wife of Francis Jr. married January 19, 1809.  Remember that Francis was in Knox County IN listed alone in the 1830 Census and had a separate entry in the 1850 census.

<BR>
Estate of Joseph Summit, initiated January 20, 1857, Monroe County, Indiana.  Gilbert Litten, Administrator.  Joseph's widow was Catharine Summit.  One person signed a paper was Daniel Summit and a January 19, 1858 payment was made to Jacob Summit.  There was a note due the estate by Lawson A. Summit dated April 4, 1857.  There is also a guardianship file relating to the minor children of this Joseph Summit, who is apparently the son of Christian Summit and Elizabeth Master born in North Carolina in 1817.  This file shows that Daniel Summit assumed responsibility for the guardianship interests of Alexander Summit (age 21 in June 1862), Elizabeth Catharine Summit, Linna S. Summit, minor heirs of Joseph Summit then residing in Cumberland County, Illinois who were joint owners of estate located in Monroe County, Indiana.  The guardianship is executed on March 19, 1862.  Alexander's full name is probably Christian Alexander.

Valentine CLINE, an old settler of Monroe County, who is enterprising in his business of farming and stock-raising, was born about 1812, in Lincoln County, N.C., and is the second of ten children born to Philip and Elizabeth (ABBENATHA) CLINE, natives of North Carolina, and of German and English decent respectively. Valentine was reared on a farm, and attended school but one month in his life. In about 1829 or 1830, he came to Indiana, locating first at Chambersville, Owen County, where he lived about four years. He then removed to the river bottom, stayed a short time, when he returned to his first
<BR>
place of residence. Mr. CLINE remained here four years, and during this time married, on March 13, 1839, Catherine, daughter of Christian and Betsey (MASTER) SUMMIT, of Monroe County. He then went near Ellettsville; remained two years; then near his present residence; then to Owen County, for two years, and finally came to the place on which he now lives. Mr. and Mrs. CLINE have three children - William Alexander, Rufus Oliver and Anna Catharine (TAYLOR. Mr. CLINE owns 146 acres of land, under good cultivation, with a good residence, barn and outbuildings. After his childrens marriage, he
<BR>
presented them with 213 acres of land. Mr. CLINE began his lifes journey by working for $8 per month, but by his unceasing industry has been able to earn this fine home farm. His wife and children belong to the Baptist Church. He is a Democrat, and from his strength and activity, it is hoped he will long be with a community who greatly honor and respect him. He has reared two of his grandchildren - Amanda and William WILSON

Introduction To The Family
<BR>
Submitted By: Emily Stelly 
<BR>

<BR>
Francis was born in Graceham, Frederick Co, MD to German emigrant, Leonard Moser and Swiss emigrant, Sarah Binkley. Leonard had come to America on September 23, 1732 aboard the ship "Adventure". In May of 1747 Leonard married Sarah and they soon started their family. Leonard Jr b. ca 1749, Jacob b. ca 1751, Peter b. June 23, 1753, Maria Sarah b. ca 1755, Anna Maria b. ca 1756, John Michael b. Aug 1, 1759, Samuel b. Apr. 4, 1761, Francis b. Mar 15, 1763, Christian b. Jan 1, 1765, Johanna Elizabeth b. Jan 30, 1867, Henrich b. Sept 12, 1769, Joseph b. July 21, 1772, Christina b. March 14, 1774. Leonard, Sarah and the children moved to Surry Co, NC about 1776. In 1778 Leonard got a land grant for 640 acres "on the Grassey Fork of Muddy Creek" in Surry Co, NC.

<BR>
Francis inlisted in 1779 at Surry Co, NC. He was in Micajah Lewis's company of a brigade commanded by General Benjamin Lincoln. When his nine month term was about to expire he was stationed at the Black Swamp on the Savannah River. He remembered while at the Black Swamp a Sgt Campbell brought around a paper for the men to sign stating that their term was expired and that they wished to go home. The troops could not be spared and he stated that Sgt Campbell was whipped for his actions in the matter. Francis then came down with camp fever, laying sick for several months. When he was able to travel, he started home and traveled about four hundred miles in a crippled condition. He was so reduced at his arrival home that his father did not know him. A couple months later he re-inlisted in a unit commanded by Col. Martin Armstrong, as a substitute for Jacob Spoonhower. Francis was in the Battle of Camden and after Gates defeat his unit scattered. Again he went home and found the country "so full of Tories" that he felt unsafe. In 1781 Francis and one of his brothers took horses and went to Maryland where they joined the militia. Francis was in Capt Murdocks Co. Francis witnessed the surrender of Cornwallis. Shortly afterwards he received his discharge and returned to Surry Co, NC and to his family.

<BR>
About 1785 or so, Francis met and married Elizabeth Miller. They moved to Lincoln Co, NC shortly thereafter and soon started a family. These are the children of that union.

<BR>
Elizabeth Miller died when her last child was about 4 yrs old. About 1815 Francis moved his family to Green Co, TN. Several of his older children had moved to Tennessee after they married and Francis wanted to be near them. On Sept 17, 1816 Francis is on the list of Communicants of St James Lutheran Church in Green Co, TN. It is believed that Francis and his family moved to Jefferson Co, TN in the spring or early summer of 1818 because the last time Francis is listed in St James Lutheran is Apr 11, 1818. 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
On Jan 3, 1826 Francis received a land grant of fifty acres in Jefferson Co, TN. In 1828, Francis, Polly and the children moved to Monroe Co, TN. Francis's eldest son Peter, born by Elizabeth Miller, had settled in the Bat Creek area of Monroe Co, TN in the mid 1820's. In the late 1820's, Francis and his new family moved near Peter and his wife Mary. When Francis died in 1863 he was buried at St Paul Lutheran Cem. A Revolutionary War marker was placed on the grave site in 1989. When Francis died he had 9 children living and 39 grandchildren.

James Madison Beasley was born in Rutherford County, Tennessee in 1830. It is suggested that his family moved to West Tennessee from Middle Tennessee when the Indian Lands opened up. A whole wagon-train of people left Middle Tennessee during this time period.
<BR>

<BR>
James joined the 1 (Fields) Tennessee Infantry of the Confederate States Army in 1861. He was wound at "Devils's Elbo" in Georgia. The story goes that he wouldn't let his company surrender when the war was over. When the Stars and Stripes were run up over the breast works of the Confederate's, he went up and tore it down. The Union soldiers put up the second flag. He went after than one, too. The winning army shot him. This is documented when he applied for a pension in 1906. He writes that he was shot in the hip and the ball came out in the back. He had chronic dysentery beginning first in a mild way during his service in the army. By this time he was almost paralyzed and unable to do any kind of manual labor. He was released from the army at the surrender in North Carolina. When asked if he took the oath of allegiance to the United States Government -- answer: NO. By 1906, he was living at Chestnut Bluff in Crockett County with hiswife, Bettie Vaughn. She was born in Murfreesboro in 1844 and they were married on May 21 or June 1, 1867. His pension application states that he was living with his wife, a son (age 23) and a daughter (age 17) on a farm which was not enough to support them.
<BR>

<BR>
He had no estate and only one cow and two horses.
<BR>

<BR>
James died in late 1906 or early 1907 as Bettie applied for a widow's pension. (gravestone says 1904) She stated that they had 10 children -- 5 boys and 5 girls. Bettie (Mary Elizabeth) died in 1913.
<BR>

<BR>
The above information was researched by Vera Dale, Scottsdale, AZ. Her great, great grandmother, Balkis Lauvina Beasley Mattis was a sister to James.  He had 1 or 2 other brothers: William N. and Harrison. William M. served in the same regiment and company. both made Lt. and one went on to be Capt. and a magistrate in Dyer or Crockett County.

<BR>
1860 Census has Hannah Clemmer, 73, living with them.
<BR>

<BR>
Following taken from bio on the internet on the Davis Family:
<BR>

<BR>
"My brother Walter C Davis received the tradition in its oral and more exciting form.  Here is what he wrote about William Davis's first home inTennessee.
<BR>

<BR>
"So far as we know, the first land which William Davis owned was
<BR>
his part of the land taken by John Clemmer and divided so that
<BR>
every child had a share.  The quarter section on which William
<BR>
Davis lived was the northwest corner of the section, being the
<BR>
land sold (later) to Peter and Jane Summitt and known to our
<BR>
family as the Summitt place..... Here he built his house on the
<BR>
rocky ridge, right on the border between the white bald ridge and
<BR>
the red knob land.  He cleared this farm, cutting and rolling
<BR>
huge logs to the bottom of the knobs and burning them.  The
<BR>
original house was still standing when I was a lad of 12 and
<BR>
visited my uncle and aunt.....  When dinner time came we ate in
<BR>
this part of the house built by William Davis, which was then the
<BR>
kitchen and dining room of Uncle Pete and Aunt Jane Summitt."
<BR>
(Dated December 20 1963)
<BR>

<BR>
There was much Union sentiment in East Tennessee, which never did vote to secede from the Union.  In fact Andrew Johnson remained a United States senator all through the war.  A son-in-law of William Davis, Peter Summitt, and a nephew, Nathan J Davis, joined the Confederate army in Tennessee.  A son, James M Davis, and a grandson, William Gaston, joined the Union army in Missouri.

Continuation of notes from Daniel Summitt
<BR>
*   This census indicates that Andrew and Amanda had been married 21 years, that Amanda had had 12 children, 9 of whom were still living.  Based on the listed birth locations for the children, Andrew and Amanda had moved to Oklahoma between 1896 and 1899.  
<BR>
*   They were renting the farm on which they were living.
<BR>
*   Elizabeth (Long) Gibson was listed as mother-in-law, rather than step- grandmother.  She listed her birthdate as October, 1824.  She indicated that she had been married 30 years and had 7 children, of whom 2 were still living.
<BR>
*   Living on an adjacent farm is Andrew's widowed sister-in-law, Amanda (44) and her children.
<BR>

<BR>
*    This census indicates that Andrew and Amanda had been married 30 years, that Amanda had had 14 children, 9 of whom were still living.  Pansy L. had apparently died some time prior to 1910, plus one other child, if the number of living children was correct.

"Dear Glen,
<BR>

<BR>
If you are a descendant of Mary David Guill, b August 28, 1862 in Clarksville, TX, m William Haskell Summit, then I am related to you.  (I found your info on Ancestry.com.)
<BR>

<BR>
I have some info about Mary David's parents and grandfather.  I am descended from her sister Beulah Benton Ironie Guill, who m James Fernander Montgomery.
<BR>

<BR>
Their father was David Crockett Guill.  My grandfather, who was Beulah's grandson (and David Crockett's great grandson), looked a great deal like the Guills, as does my niece.  Apparently the Red River Co/Van Zandt Co Guills were a colorful bunch -- David Crockett Guill raised and raced horses!
<BR>

<BR>
My aunt, Marilyn Miller, has even more info.
<BR>

<BR>
We are also related to the Rita Guill who posts on the GenForum Guill
<BR>
page (as have my aunt and I).

<BR>
Date:  01/08/2000 7:28:42 AM Pacific Standard Time

From:  doncross@bellsouth.net (Don & Susan Cross)
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Paul, I just ready several of your wonderful articles on the Summit
<BR>
Family.  The last one, "Daniel Summit, Son of Francis Summit" was of
<BR>
most interest to me because Daniel is my Great Great Great Grandfather.
<BR>
The following is my lineage:  Mother - Dorothy Jean Summitt Cross,
<BR>
Grandfather - Bryant Elijah Summitt (note my Grandfather added the
<BR>
second "t" to his name), Great Grandfather - John Ballard Summit, Great
<BR>
Great Grandfather - John Francis Summit, Great Great Great Grandfather,
<BR>
Daniel Summit.  Thanks to these articles I now have a wonderful family
<BR>
history dating back to the Revolutionary War.
<BR>

<BR>
The last article seemed to pose several questions that lacked answers.
<BR>
They were: 1) What happened to Daniel (son of Daniel)? and 2) What
<BR>
happened to John?
<BR>

<BR>
I believe it is possible that the "missing John" and the Francis
<BR>
referred in your article on Daniel Summit are really one and the same.
<BR>
Francis's tombstone in the Barber Cemetery list his name as John Francis
<BR>
Summit.  Daniel, son of Daniel, also came to Arkansas with John
<BR>
Francis.  If memory serves correct, I believe Daniel,  is buried in the
<BR>
Long Valley Church of God Cemetery just a mile from Sims, Arkansas.
<BR>
What I will do is write down as much of the history that I can get from
<BR>
Aldon Summit, my cousin in Hot Springs.  Aldon is the son of my
<BR>
Grandfather Bryant Elijah's twin brother, Steelie Elisha.  He now seems
<BR>
to be the one who knows the most about the Arkansas branch of the Summit
<BR>
Family.
<BR>

<BR>
Again, thanks for such wonderful articles and let me know if I can help
<BR>
in future search's.
